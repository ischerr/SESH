<p><strong>As of September 2019, 279 </strong>renewable electricity projects with a capacity of <strong>12.9 GW </strong>are in the <strong>pipeline</strong>. Projects in the pipeline comprise of <strong>1.2 GW </strong>of capacity <strong>under construction</strong>, <strong>7.9 GW </strong>awaiting <strong>construction</strong> and <strong>3.8 GW in planning</strong>. <strong>Wind</strong> makes up the majority of consented projects in the pipeline with <strong>7.6 GW</strong> of <strong>onshore</strong> wind and <strong>4.1 GW</strong> of <strong>offshore</strong> wind. <strong>Non-wind</strong> projects make up <strong>1.1 GW</strong> of pipeline capacity.</p>
<p>Were all capacity in the pipeline to be delivered it would more than double the level currently deployed, and could generate an estimated <strong>31,000 GWh </strong>of renewable electricity. It is worth noting, however, that there are a number of factors that mean that projects consented in the pipeline may not progress to commissioning.</p>
