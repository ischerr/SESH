<p>It is possible to look at the <strong>fuel mix</strong> which makes up <strong>regional consumption</strong> via the National Grid&rsquo;s <a href="https://carbonintensity.org.uk/">Carbon Intensity website</a>.</p>
<p>It shows that from <strong>October 2018</strong> to <strong>September 2019</strong>, more than four-fifths (<strong>82.7%</strong>) of the electricity that <strong>Scotland</strong> <strong>consumes</strong> comes from <strong>low carbon</strong> sources, with <strong>55.5%</strong> from <strong>renewable</strong> sources. More than two-fifths (<strong>43.1%</strong>) of the electricity consumed in Scotland comes from <strong>wind</strong> generation. As with generation, <strong>consumption</strong> of electricity from <strong>low carbon</strong> (<strong>48.3%</strong>) and <strong>renewable</strong> (<strong>29.4%</strong>) sources are substantially <strong>lower</strong> across <strong>England and Wales</strong>.</p>
