<p>It is possible to look at the <strong>fuel mix</strong> which makes up <strong>regional consumption</strong> via the National Grid&rsquo;s <a href="https://carbonintensity.org.uk/">Carbon Intensity website</a>.</p>
<p>It shows that in <strong>2019,</strong> <strong>84.0%</strong> of the electricity that <strong>Scotland</strong> <strong>consumed</strong> came from <strong>low carbon</strong> sources, with half (<strong>52.9%</strong>) from <strong>renewable</strong> sources. More than two-fifths (<strong>41.6%</strong>) of the electricity consumed in Scotland came from <strong>wind</strong> generation. As with generation, <strong>consumption</strong> from electricity from <strong>low carbon</strong> (<strong>48.8%</strong>) and <strong>renewable</strong> (<strong>29.5%</strong>) sources are substantially <strong>lower</strong> across <strong>England and Wales</strong>.</p>
