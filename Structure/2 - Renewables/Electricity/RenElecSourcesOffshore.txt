<p>Offshore wind is rapidly growing in Scotland -&nbsp;<strong>capacity</strong>&nbsp;quadrupled from&nbsp;<strong>0.25 GW</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>June 2018</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>1.0 GW</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>September 2019</strong>&nbsp;with the Beatrice wind farm in the Moray Firth becoming operational in 2019.&nbsp; This led to almost&nbsp;<strong>3,000 GWh</strong>&nbsp;of electricity generated via offshore wind between&nbsp;<strong>October 2018</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>September 2019</strong>.&nbsp; Offshore wind is likely to play more of a role in the future;&nbsp;<strong>twelve</strong>&nbsp;offshore wind projects are in&nbsp;<strong>development</strong>, which make up a third (32.0%) of all capacity of renewable electricity projects in the pipeline, totalling&nbsp;<strong>4.1 GW</strong>&nbsp;if all become operational.&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity generation via offsore wind may have generated&nbsp;<strong>&pound;0.26 billion</strong>&nbsp;in turnover in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>, but has directly supported approximately&nbsp;<strong>1,700&nbsp;</strong>full-time equivalent&nbsp;<strong>jobs&nbsp;</strong>in Scotland.</p>
