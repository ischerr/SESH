<p>Scotland had <strong>11.7 GW </strong>of installed renewable electricity generation <strong>capacity operational in September 2019</strong>. This has steadily risen over time, and has increased from <strong>10.8 GW </strong>twelve months prior. The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> estimates that installed capacity of renewable electricity will be between <strong>12 - 17 GW </strong>by <strong>2030</strong>. Current installed capacity is closing in to this window already. Most of Scotland&rsquo;s operational capacity comes from <strong>onshore wind</strong> (<strong>8.2 GW</strong>).</p>
