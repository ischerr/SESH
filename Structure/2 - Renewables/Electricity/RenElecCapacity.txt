<p>Scotland had <strong>11.7 GW </strong>of installed renewable electricity generation <strong>capacity operational in September 2019</strong>. This has steadily risen over time, and has increased from <strong>10.8 GW </strong>twelve months prior. The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> estimates that installed capacity of renewable electricity will be between <strong>12 - 17 GW </strong>by <strong>2030</strong>. Current installed capacity is closing in to this window already. Most of Scotland&rsquo;s operational capacity comes from <strong>onshore wind</strong> (<strong>8.2 GW</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>As of September 2019, 279 </strong>renewable electricity projects with a capacity of <strong>12.9 GW </strong>are in the <strong>pipeline</strong>. Projects in the pipeline comprise of <strong>1.2 GW </strong>of capacity <strong>under construction</strong>, <strong>7.9 GW </strong>awaiting <strong>construction</strong> and <strong>3.8 GW in planning</strong>. <strong>Wind</strong> makes up the majority of consented projects in the pipeline with <strong>7.6 GW</strong> of <strong>onshore</strong> wind and <strong>4.1 GW</strong> of <strong>offshore</strong> wind. <strong>Non-wind</strong> projects make up <strong>1.1 GW</strong> of pipeline capacity.</p>
<p>Were all capacity in the pipeline to be delivered it would more than double the level currently deployed, and could generate an estimated <strong>31,000 GWh </strong>of renewable electricity. It is worth noting, however, that there are a number of factors that mean that projects consented in the pipeline may not progress to commissioning.</p>
