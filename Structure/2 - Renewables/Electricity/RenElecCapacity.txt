<p>As of <strong>March 2019</strong>, Scotland had <strong>11.3 GW </strong>of installed renewable electricity generation <strong>capacity operational</strong>. This has steadily risen over time, and has increased from <strong>10.2 GW </strong>twelve months prior. According to the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a>, it is expected that installed capacity of renewable electricity generation will be between <strong>12 - 17 GW </strong>by <strong>2030</strong>. Current installed capacity is closing in to this window already.</p>
<p><strong>275 </strong>renewable electricity projects with a capacity of <strong>12.9 GW </strong>are in the <strong>pipeline</strong>. This too has been rising, up from <strong>11.2 GW </strong>in March 2018. Projects in the pipeline are made up of <strong>0.6 GW </strong>of capacity <strong>under construction</strong>, <strong>7.5 GW </strong>awaiting <strong>construction</strong> and <strong>4.8 GW in planning</strong>. It is worth noting, however, that there are a number of factors which mean that projects consented in the pipeline may not progress to commissioning.</p>
<p>There is currently <strong>24.3 GW </strong>of renewable electricity capacity either already operating in the pipeline. Were all this capacity to be delivered it would more than double the level currently deployed. If all projects were operational, it is estimated that this could generate almost <strong>31,500 GWh </strong>of renewable electricity.</p>
