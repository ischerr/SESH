<p>The electricity generation mix in Scotland has significantly changed in recent years driven by privatisation and subsidy schemes introduced to encourage the development of low carbon and renewable technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has meant that the vast majority of the electricity that Scotland generates is from&nbsp;<strong>low carbon&nbsp;</strong>sources,&nbsp;<strong>83.1%&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2018, compared to 15.7% generated from fossil fuels</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, electricity generation from fossil fuels increased in the most recent year, up from <strong>10.3%</strong> in <strong>2017</strong>. Generation from natural <strong>gas</strong> reached its <strong>highest point</strong> since <strong>2011</strong>. Gas electricity generation may be making up for a <strong>drop</strong> in <strong>nuclear</strong> electricity generation (<strong>36.8%</strong> in <strong>2017</strong> to <strong>28.2%</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>) stemming from long-term outages at Hunterston B towards the end of 2018.</p>
<p>The sources of electricity generation in Scotland have changed rapidly since&nbsp;<strong>2010&nbsp;</strong>when approximately half of Scotland&rsquo;s generation came from&nbsp;each of <strong>low carbon&nbsp;</strong>sources and <strong>fossil fuels</strong>. The&nbsp;<strong>growth of renewables drove the increase in low carbon generation</strong>, rising from&nbsp;<strong>19.2%&nbsp;</strong>of all generation in&nbsp;<strong>2010</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>54.9%&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;National and international incentives, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/ro">Renewables Obligation</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive">EU Renewable Energy Directive</a>, contributed towards the increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast, <strong>England and Wales </strong>use a significantly <strong>smaller proportion </strong>of <strong>low carbon (47.6%) </strong>and <strong>renewable (28.9%) </strong>sources for electricity generation than Scotland. <strong>Fossil fuels</strong> comprise half (<strong>49.6%</strong>) of England and Wales&rsquo; electricity generation, with <strong>gas</strong> making up most of this (<strong>43.7% of all generation</strong>).</p>
