<p>Since&nbsp;<strong>2000</strong>, Scottish renewables have&nbsp;<strong>displaced&nbsp;</strong>an estimated&nbsp;<strong>136 million tonnes&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<strong>CO2</strong>&nbsp;across the GB system, assuming that the same amount of electricity would have been generated by fossil fuels.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>2018&nbsp;</strong>alone, Scottish renewable electricity has displaced an estimated&nbsp;<strong>11.9 million tonnes of CO2.</strong>&nbsp; For context, this is equivalent to almost 30% of Scotland&rsquo;s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 (<strong>40.5</strong> million tonnes of CO2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The estimated amount of CO2 displaced has dropped from its <strong>peak </strong>of <strong>13.6 million tonnes </strong>of CO2 in <strong>2015 </strong>because in recent years coal power stations have closed, and renewables have tended to displace more gas rather than coal. This has had the effect of reducing the carbon intensity of the remaining fossil fuel fleet across Britain and therefore the level of displaced emissions.</p>
