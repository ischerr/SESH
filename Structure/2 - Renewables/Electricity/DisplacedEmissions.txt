<p>Since&nbsp;<strong>2000</strong>, Scottish renewables have&nbsp;<strong>displaced&nbsp;</strong>an estimated&nbsp;<strong>136 million tonnes&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<strong>CO2</strong>&nbsp;across the GB system, assuming that the same amount of electricity would have been generated by fossil fuels.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>2018&nbsp;</strong>alone, Scottish renewable electricity has displaced an estimated&nbsp;<strong>11.9 million tonnes of CO2.</strong>&nbsp; For context, this is equivalent to almost <strong>30%</strong> of Scotland&rsquo;s total <strong>greenhouse gas emissions</strong> in 2017 (40.5 million tonnes of CO2).</p>
<p>The estimated amount of CO2 displaced dropped from its <strong>peak </strong>of <strong>13.6 million tonnes </strong>of CO2 in <strong>2015.&nbsp; </strong>This is because of the closure of coal power stations across Britain in recent years, and renewables rather than gas tended to fill the void in electricity generation. This had the effect of reducing the carbon intensity of the remaining fossil fuel fleet across Britain and therefore the level of displaced emissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The estimate of carbon displacement <strong>rose</strong> again in <strong>2017</strong> and <strong>2018</strong>, primarily due to the increase in<strong> renewable electricity generated</strong> in Scotland.</p>
