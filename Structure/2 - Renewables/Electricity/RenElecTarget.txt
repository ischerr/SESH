<p>The Scottish Government has a target to generate the equivalent of&nbsp;<strong>100%</strong>&nbsp;of Scotland&rsquo;s own electricity demand from renewable sources by&nbsp;<strong>2020</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not mean that Scotland will be fully dependent on renewables generation, but rather that renewables will form the key part of a wider, balanced electricity mix.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>, the equivalent of&nbsp;<strong>76.2%&nbsp;</strong>of gross electricity consumption* was from renewable sources, rising from&nbsp;<strong>70.1%&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of this increase is due to&nbsp;<strong>wind</strong>; in the last year there was almost a&nbsp;<strong>1 GW increase&nbsp;</strong>in wind&nbsp;<strong>capacity</strong>, which contributed to around a&nbsp;<strong>2,100 GWh&nbsp;</strong>increase in electricity&nbsp;<strong>generation&nbsp;</strong>via wind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is too early to say if Scotland is on track to meet the 100% target by 2020 as it will depend on how much renewable electricity generation increases and gross consumption decreases in the next few years.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to meet the target, an estimated <strong>14-15 GW&nbsp;</strong>of installed&nbsp;<strong>renewable capacity&nbsp;</strong>is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of <strong>September 2019</strong>, Scotland has&nbsp;<strong>11.7 GW</strong>&nbsp;of installed&nbsp;<strong>capacity&nbsp;</strong>operational with&nbsp;<strong>12.9 GW&nbsp;</strong>in the&nbsp;<strong>pipeline</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;How quickly these projects become operational and the extent to which gross consumption falls in the next two years will determine if the target is reached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Gross electricity consumption refers to total electricity generation minus net exports</p>
