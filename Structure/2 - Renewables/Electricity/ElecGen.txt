<p>There have been significant changes to the electricity generation mix in recent years driven by privatisation and subsidy schemes introduced to encourage the development of low carbon and renewable technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has meant that the vast majority of the electricity that Scotland generates is from&nbsp;<strong>low carbon&nbsp;</strong>sources,&nbsp;<strong>88.3%&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that&nbsp;<strong>fossil fuel&nbsp;</strong>generation in Scotland is at its lowest level, with just one-tenth&nbsp;<strong>(10.5%)&nbsp;</strong>of all electricity generated from oil or gas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sources of electricity generation in Scotland have changed rapidly since&nbsp;<strong>2010&nbsp;</strong>when just&nbsp;<strong>50.1%&nbsp;</strong>of Scotland&rsquo;s generation came from&nbsp;<strong>low carbon&nbsp;</strong>sources and&nbsp;<strong>48.4%&nbsp;</strong>from&nbsp;<strong>fossil fuels</strong>.</p>
<p>The increase in low carbon generation witnessed in the last decade is driven by the&nbsp;<strong>growth of renewables</strong>, rising from&nbsp;<strong>19.2%&nbsp;</strong>of all generation in&nbsp;<strong>2010</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>51.7%&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;National and international incentives, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/ro" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/ro&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567257774881000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHlG-_p6lHsmp-N4cryBq5Bm2n0UQ">Renewables Obligation</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567257774881000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHJNy5Xgh8x3bb5cCdC4TptaICj6w">EU Renewable Energy Directive</a>, have helped contribute towards the increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been more renewable electricity generation than from nuclear for three of the last four years.&nbsp;</p>
