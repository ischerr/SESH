<p>Since&nbsp;<strong>2000</strong>, Scottish renewables have&nbsp;<strong>displaced&nbsp;</strong>an estimated&nbsp;<strong>136 million tonnes&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<strong>CO2</strong>&nbsp;across the GB system, assuming that the same amount of electricity would have been generated by fossil fuels.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>2018&nbsp;</strong>alone, Scottish renewable electricity has displaced an estimated&nbsp;<strong>11.9 million tonnes of CO2.</strong>&nbsp; For context, this is equivalent to almost 30% of Scotland&rsquo;s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 (<strong>40.5</strong> million tonnes of CO2).</p>
