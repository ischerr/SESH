<p>Scotland's renewable energy target is calculated by the sum of renewable electricity and heat generation and estimated biofuel use in transport in Scotland, <b>divided by</b> Scotland's gross electricity consumption, non-electrical heat demand and energy used for transport. Therefore, progress towards the target will come from&nbsp;<strong>increasing renewable generation&nbsp;</strong><em>and</em><strong>&nbsp;reducing energy consumption.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provisional figures for&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>&nbsp;indicate that&nbsp;<strong>20.9%</strong>&nbsp;of total Scottish energy consumption came from renewable sources; the highest level to date. It has&nbsp;<strong>increased</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>19.2%</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>. Renewable energy generated <strong>increased</strong> by over <strong>2,500 GWh</strong> between <strong>2017</strong> and <strong>2018</strong>. This includes almost <strong>1,500 GWh</strong> extra renewable <strong>electricity</strong> generated thanks to an additional <strong>1.0 GW</strong> installed capacity of onshore and offshore <strong>wind</strong> between 2017 and 2018. Renewable electricity contributes about four-fifths of all Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy, followed by renewable heat and biofuels in transport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The total amount of renewable energy generated in 2018&nbsp;<strong>(33,269 GWh)</strong>&nbsp;is the equivalent of powering and heating more than&nbsp;<strong>1.9 million households</strong>&nbsp;in Scotland, assuming average electricity and gas usage for households in Scotland.</p>
