<p>The 2030 energy productivity target is a measure of the&nbsp;<strong>combination</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>energy consumption</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>output of the economy.</strong>&nbsp;It is measured by the&nbsp;<strong>gross value added (GVA)*</strong> achieved in the economy from the&nbsp;<strong>input of one gigawatt hour of energy.</strong> Higher energy productivity means you get more economic activity for each unit of energy used, in other words, squeezing more value added out of every unit of energy consumed across the economy.</p>
<p>The target is a&nbsp;<strong>30% increase</strong>&nbsp;in energy productivity by&nbsp;<strong>2030</strong>&nbsp;from a baseline of&nbsp;<strong>2015</strong>. This mirrors the improvement in energy productivity between&nbsp;<strong>2005</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>2015</strong>&nbsp;(energy productivity increased by&nbsp;<strong>30.4%</strong>&nbsp;in this period, from&nbsp;<strong>&pound;0.742m GVA per GWh</strong>&nbsp;consumed to&nbsp;<strong>&pound;0.967m</strong>). This was driven by <strong>reducing energy consumption</strong> (<strong>down</strong> by <strong>16.7%</strong>) and <strong>increased GVA</strong> (<strong>up</strong> by <strong>8.6%</strong>)</p>
<p>Provisional figures for&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>&nbsp;estimate that energy productivity in Scotland is&nbsp;<strong>&pound;0.971m GVA per GWh,</strong> <strong>0.4%</strong>&nbsp;above the 2015 baseline. The reason for the slower progress from 2015 is that <strong>energy consumption</strong> <strong>increased</strong> by <strong>3.2%</strong> between <strong>2015</strong> and <strong>2018</strong>. Energy productivity still increased because Scottish <strong>GVA rose </strong>by<strong> 3.6%</strong> in this period. Compared to <strong>2017</strong>, energy productivity improved by <strong>1.6%</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>, mainly due to growth in GVA.</p>
