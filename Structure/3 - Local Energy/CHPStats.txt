<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, Scotland had <strong>178 </strong>separate <strong>combined heat and power schemes</strong>, steadily <strong>rising </strong>from <strong>70 </strong>in <strong>2005</strong>. In total, Scotland&rsquo;s combined heat and power schemes generated <strong>6,155 GWh </strong>of <strong>heat </strong>in 2018 which would have been wasted otherwise, a small decrease on last year. The heat generated is the equivalent of heating approximately <strong>455,000 homes </strong>in <strong>Scotland </strong>using the estimate for the average domestic gas consumption per household.</p>
<p>While the number of CHP <strong>schemes </strong>in Scotland have <strong>increased</strong>, the amount of <strong>heat generated </strong>has <strong>dropped </strong>by almost <strong>2,300 GWh </strong>from its peak in <strong>2005</strong>. This mirrors the UK wide trend of the cessation of larger industrial based schemes that generate high amounts of heat and the growth of smaller non-industrial schemes.</p>
