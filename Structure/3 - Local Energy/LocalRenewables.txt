<p><strong>Targets </strong>were set for <a href="https://www.gov.scot/policies/renewable-and-low-carbon-energy/local-and-small-scale-renewables/">community and locally-owned renewables</a> with the aim of having <strong>1 GW </strong>of capacity by <strong>2020 </strong>and <strong>2 GW </strong>by <strong>2030</strong>.</p>
<p>As of June <strong>2018</strong>, <strong>697 MW </strong>of community and locally owned capacity is operational. This has more than tripled from June <strong>2012 </strong>when capacity was <strong>204 MW</strong>.</p>
<p>Projects totalling more than <strong>627 MW </strong>are in the pipeline, including <strong>54 MW under construction </strong>and a further <strong>421 MW consented</strong> but not built. The combination of all of this capacity would take Scotland beyond its 2020 target.</p>
<p>The majority of operational community and locally-owned renewable capacity in Scotland in June <strong>2018 </strong>was from <strong>wind </strong>turbines (<strong>319 MW</strong>), followed by <strong>biomass </strong>(<strong>185 MW</strong>). These two technologies account for almost three quarters of overall operational capacity in June 2018.</p>
<p>The <strong>697 MW </strong>of total operational capacity is split between <strong>432 MW </strong>(62.0%) of <strong>electrical capacity</strong> and <strong>256 MW</strong> (36.7%) of <strong>thermal</strong> (heat) <strong>capacity</strong>.</p>
<p>Over the course of a year, community and locally owned renewable energy installations identified here could be expected to produce <strong>1,755 GWh </strong>of renewable energy - <strong>1,051 GWh </strong>of <strong>electricity </strong>and <strong>656 GWh </strong>of <strong>heat</strong>. This is enough to <strong>power </strong>over <strong>258,000 </strong>Scottish <strong>homes </strong>and <strong>heat </strong>almost <strong>48,000 </strong>Scottish homes <strong>for a year</strong>.</p>
