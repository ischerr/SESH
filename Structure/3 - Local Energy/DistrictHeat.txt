<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/policies/energy-efficiency/decarbonising-heat/">Heat Policy Statement</a> published in 2015 set out two <strong>ambitions </strong>relating to district and communal heating in Scotland:</p>
<ul>
<li>To achieve <strong>1.5 TWh </strong>of Scotland&rsquo;s heat demand to be delivered by district or communal heating by <strong>2020</strong></li>
<li>To have <strong>40,000 </strong>homes connected by <strong>2020.</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Estimates suggest that there were <strong>almost 30,000 </strong>homes connected to <strong>district or communal heating networks </strong>in Scotland at the end of <strong>2018 </strong>meaning that Scotland is approximately three quarters of the way towards reaching 40,000 homes connected to heat networks. In terms of new connections, the data up to end of December 2018 included 35 additional networks compared to December 2017. Together these &lsquo;new&rsquo; networks supplied approximately <strong>1,250 more homes </strong>than <strong>2017</strong>.</p>
<p>An estimated <strong>1.18 TWh </strong>of heat and cooling demand is supplied via <strong>heat networks</strong>, equivalent to 79% of the 1.5 TWh ambition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the collection of this data is still quite new, and will continue to improve in quality in time. There are issues with some networks not providing supply figures and others giving figures which appear to be unreasonable. While efforts have been made to correct these figures, the data should be treated as broad estimates at this stage. As a consequence, the figures quoted for district heat networks in Energy In Scotland last year are not directly comparable with the figures quoted in ACSES.</p>
