<p>TO UPDATE</p>
<p>For <strong>gas</strong>, demand is <strong>secured </strong>at a <strong>GB level</strong>. GB supplies come from a mixture of North Sea gas fields and imported supplies from pipelines within continental Europe, or from liquefied natural gas from international markets.</p>
<p><strong>Gas </strong>physically <strong>consumed </strong>in <strong>Scotland </strong>currently comes entirely from gas that flows into the <strong>St Fergus gas terminal </strong>in Aberdeenshire - approximately <strong>186 TWh </strong>in <strong>2018</strong>. This is more than ample to account for Scotland&rsquo;s gas demand, which comprises less than a quarter (<strong>22.7%</strong>) of all of St Fergus&rsquo; gas.</p>
<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, Scotland&rsquo;s daily <strong>gas demand ranged </strong>from <strong>8.1% </strong>of gas that flowed through St. Fergus on <strong>28th July </strong>to <strong>43.5% </strong>on the <strong>1st March </strong>- the day when the &ldquo;Beast from the East&rdquo; weather front hit the UK.</p>
<p>Imports and domestic supply that are distributed from <strong>St Fergus </strong>accounts for approximately <strong>one third </strong>of <strong>all </strong>of <strong>UK&rsquo;s gas</strong>.</p>
