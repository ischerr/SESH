<p>From a security of supply perspective, it is important to look at the supply capability of the system which can be relied on at times of high demand. As such, the analysis here <strong><u>excludes</u> intermittent renewable generators</strong> including <strong>wind </strong>and <strong>solar</strong>.</p>
<p>Discounting these, Scotland had a maximum supply capacity of <strong>10.0 GW </strong>available in <strong>2018/19</strong>. This breaks down as <strong>5.6 GW </strong>of non-intermittent generation in Scotland and <strong>4.4 GW </strong>of import capability. The main sources of domestic generation capacity are: more than <strong>2.3 GW</strong> from <strong>nuclear </strong>(from Hunterston B and Torness), <strong>1.3 GW </strong>of <strong>large hydro </strong>plants, almost <strong>1.2 GW </strong>from <strong>gas </strong>(Peterhead) and <strong>0.7 GW </strong>of <strong>pumped hydro </strong>(Cruachan and Foyers)<strong>. </strong>The <strong>secure import capability </strong>consists of <strong>0.5 GW </strong>of capacity available on the <strong>Moyle interconnector</strong> from Northern Ireland and <strong>3.9 GW </strong>of on transmission networks from <strong>England and Wales</strong>. This import capacity refers to what <em>could</em> still be safely imported following major faults on the electricity system. The <strong>2018/19</strong> supply capacity rose from <strong>8.6 GW </strong>due to increased capacity via the<strong> Western Link </strong>between Scotland and Wales.</p>
<p>From a security of supply perspective the important comparison is maximum capacity with the level of <strong>peak demand</strong>. In the chart, the <strong>maximum supply capacity </strong>is plotted against the <strong>peak demand </strong>for each year. Scotland&rsquo;s electricity system remained <strong>secure </strong>in each year in terms of having confidence that we can meet peak demand. Scotland&rsquo;s peak demand in winter <strong>2018/19</strong> was <strong>5.3 GW</strong>, comfortably within <strong>maximum supply capacity </strong>of <strong>10.0 GW</strong>. If we express peak demand as a percentage of maximum supply capacity, <strong>52.7%</strong> in winter 2018/19 is the lowest percentage since 2015/16 when Longannet coal power station was still operational.</p>
