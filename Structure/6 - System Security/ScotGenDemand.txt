<p>Another way we can understand how Scottish and GB-wide security of supply interact is to consider what proportion of the time <strong>Scotland </strong>is able to meet its <strong>electrical demand </strong>from its <strong>own generation</strong>. The chart shows the proportion of time (based on half hour settlement periods) across the year where <strong>Scottish generation exceeds </strong>estimated <strong>demand</strong>. It shows that for the last ten years, Scotland has almost always met its own electricity demand via its own generation; in <strong>2018</strong>, this was <strong>98.1% </strong>of the time. During the remaining 1.9% of the year - approximately <strong>165 hours</strong> - we had the ability to <strong>import </strong>electricity into Scotland. This is an important role for the electricity transmission network.</p>
<p><strong>Excluding wind</strong>, <strong>Scottish generation met demand </strong>an estimated <strong>77.0% </strong>of the time in 2018. This has fallen from <strong>98.4% </strong>in <strong>2015 </strong>after which Longannet closed. These figures suggest that there is at least <strong>some wind </strong>generation for the <strong>vast majority </strong>of the time. Analysis suggests that in <strong>2019</strong>, there was sufficient <strong>wind </strong>across Scotland to generate <strong>at least 200 MW </strong>per half hour for <strong>98.7% </strong>of the time.</p>
<p>For almost three quarters (<strong>73.9%</strong>) of the time in <strong>2019</strong>, Scotland <strong>met its own demand </strong>with its <strong>domestic low carbon generation only </strong>(renewables and nuclear), <strong>down </strong>from its peak of <strong>77.9% </strong>in <strong>2017</strong>. This is likely to be related to outages in Hunterston nuclear power station in 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>Scotland&rsquo;s rapid rise in renewable electricity generation means that <strong>renewables </strong>alone <strong>met electricity demand </strong>for an estimated <strong>42.6% </strong>of the time in <strong>2019, </strong>rising from <strong>0.0% </strong>as recently as <strong>2012.</strong></p>
