<p>Another way we can understand how Scottish and GB-wide security of supply interact is to consider what proportion of the time&nbsp;<strong>Scotland&nbsp;</strong>is able to meet its&nbsp;<strong>electrical demand&nbsp;</strong>from its&nbsp;<strong>own generation</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chart below shows the proportion of time (based on half hour settlement periods) across the year where&nbsp;<strong>Scottish generation exceeds&nbsp;</strong>estimated&nbsp;<strong>demand</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It shows that for the last ten years, Scotland has almost always met its own electricity demand via its own generation; in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>, this was&nbsp;<strong>98.6%&nbsp;</strong>of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;During the remaining 1.4% of the year - approximately 120 hours, we had the ability to&nbsp;<strong>import&nbsp;</strong>electricity into Scotland.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important role for the electricity transmission network.</p>
<p><strong>Excluding wind</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Scottish generation met demand&nbsp;</strong>an estimated&nbsp;<strong>81.6%&nbsp;</strong>of the time in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has fallen from&nbsp;<strong>98.4%&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2015&nbsp;</strong>after which Longannet closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures suggest that there is at least&nbsp;<strong>some wind&nbsp;</strong>generation for the&nbsp;<strong>vast majority&nbsp;</strong>of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis suggests that in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>, there was sufficient&nbsp;<strong>wind&nbsp;</strong>across Scotland to generate&nbsp;<strong>at least 200 MW&nbsp;</strong>per half hour for&nbsp;<strong>94.1%&nbsp;</strong>of the time.</p>
<p>For&nbsp;<strong>69.6%&nbsp;</strong>of the time in&nbsp;<strong>2018</strong>, Scotland&nbsp;<strong>met its own demand&nbsp;</strong>with its&nbsp;<strong>domestic low carbon generation only&nbsp;</strong>(renewables and nuclear),&nbsp;<strong>down&nbsp;</strong>from its peak of&nbsp;<strong>76.9%&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is likely to be related to outages in Hunterston nuclear power station in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scotland&rsquo;s rapid rise in renewable electricity generation means that&nbsp;<strong>renewables&nbsp;</strong>alone&nbsp;<strong>met electricity demand&nbsp;</strong>for an estimated&nbsp;<strong>28.5%&nbsp;</strong>of the time in&nbsp;<strong>2018,&nbsp;</strong>rising from&nbsp;<strong>0.0%&nbsp;</strong>as recently as&nbsp;<strong>2012.</strong></p>
