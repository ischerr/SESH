<p>While consumption in all other sectors declined since the 2005-07 baseline, it has <strong>increased </strong>slightly in the <strong>transport</strong> sector, up by <strong>1.1% </strong>to <strong>38,841 GWh </strong>in <strong>2017</strong>. This is the highest level since 2008, and has <strong>increased </strong>by <strong>2.9% </strong>since <strong>2016</strong>. This is likely to be a consequence of a <strong>3.3%</strong> <strong>rise</strong> in <strong>traffic</strong> in Scotland in 2017 according to road traffic estimates published by Department for Transport.</p>
<p>The <strong>composition </strong>of Scottish transport energy consumption has changed over time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption of fuel for <strong>personal road transport </strong>(buses, cars, motorcycles) has <strong>decreased </strong>by <strong>5.7%</strong>. Conversely <strong>freight </strong>has <strong>increased </strong>by <strong>15.1%</strong>.</li>
<li>Consumption from <strong>diesel </strong>cars has <strong>increased </strong>by <strong>63.7%</strong>, whereas consumption from <strong>petrol</strong> vehicles has <strong>dropped </strong>by <strong>34.8%</strong></li>
<li>Energy consumption from <strong>buses </strong>has <strong>decreased </strong>by <strong>11.4% </strong>but <strong>rail </strong>has <strong>risen </strong>by <strong>6.7%</strong></li>
