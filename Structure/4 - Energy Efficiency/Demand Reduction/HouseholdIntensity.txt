<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> sets ambitions in both the <strong>residential</strong> sector to for <strong>energy</strong> and <strong>emissions</strong> <strong>intensity</strong> to <strong>fall</strong> by <strong>30%</strong> from <strong>2015</strong> levels. Energy intensity is the average energy use per household in Scotland. Emissions intensity is average emissions per household.</p>
<p>From <strong>2005</strong>, <strong>energy intensity fell</strong> by <strong>23.7%</strong> to <strong>18,157 kWh</strong> in <strong>2017</strong>, and this is due to a <strong>17.4%</strong> <strong>decrease</strong> in <strong>energy consumption</strong> thanks to energy efficiency, while the number of <strong>households</strong> <strong>increased</strong> by <strong>8.3%</strong>. From <strong>2015</strong> to <strong>2017</strong>, energy intensity fell by just <strong>0.9%</strong>, and in fact increased slightly in the most recent year due to a rise in domestic energy consumption.</p>
<p>Between <strong>2015</strong> and <strong>2017</strong> <strong>emissions intensity</strong> in the residential sector <strong>fell</strong> by <strong>2.3%</strong> to <strong>2.46 tons of carbon dioxide per household</strong> a year. This is a <strong>decrease</strong> of <strong>4.9%</strong> on <strong>2016</strong> after emissions intensity increased between 2015 and 2016. These trends were driven by the level of residential emissions. Between <strong>1998</strong> and <strong>2017</strong>, residential emissions intensity <strong>fell</strong> by <strong>34.5%</strong>. This is a product of <strong>residential emissions dropping</strong> by <strong>25.0%</strong> in this period and the number of <strong>households</strong> <strong>increasing</strong> by <strong>14.4%</strong>.</p>
