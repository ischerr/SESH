<p>For <strong>gas</strong> specifically, consumption dropped by <strong>20.4%</strong> overall from <strong>2005-07</strong> to <strong>2018</strong>. The saving in gas consumption between 2005 and 2018 is the equivalent of almost half of the annual gas use in Scottish homes.

<p>The <strong>average gas consumption per household dropped</strong> by <strong>30.2%</strong> from <strong>2005-07</strong> to <strong>2018</strong>. In this period, the number of households increased by 8.9%, which illustrates the role that energy efficiency measures and improvements in the building stock made in reducing gas demand.</p>

In <strong>2018</strong>, gas use is <strong>2.4%</strong> <strong>greater</strong> than its <strong>lowest point</strong> in <strong>2016</strong>.
