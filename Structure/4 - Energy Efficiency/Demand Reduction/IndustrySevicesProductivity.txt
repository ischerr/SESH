<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> sets ambitions in both the <strong>industrial</strong> and <strong>services</strong> sectors to <strong>improve</strong> <strong>energy productivity</strong> by <strong>30%</strong>, and for <strong>emissions intensity</strong> to <strong>fall</strong> by <strong>30%</strong> from a <strong>2015</strong> baseline, through a combination of fuel diversification, energy efficiency improvements and heat recovery. Energy productivity is calculated as sectoral GVA divided by energy consumption in each sector. Emissions intensity is sectoral emissions divided by GVA in each sector.</p>
<p>In <strong>2017</strong>, <strong>industrial energy productivity decreased</strong> by <strong>6.0%</strong> from the <strong>2015</strong> figure. Even though industrial <strong>GVA</strong> <strong>increased</strong> by <strong>1.3%</strong> between 2015 and 2017, this does not compensate for a <strong>7.8%</strong> <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>consumption</strong> in the same period, hence the negative trend.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial emissions intensity</strong> <strong>rose</strong> by <strong>3.5%</strong> from <strong>2015</strong> to <strong>2017</strong>, although much of this increase came in 2016 when industrial emissions increased and industrial GVA decreased. Industrial emissions intensity is starting to move in the right direction, <strong>falling</strong> <strong>1.9%</strong> from <strong>2016</strong> levels.</p>
<p><strong>Energy productivity</strong> in the <strong>services</strong> sector is <strong>similar</strong> in <strong>2017</strong> to <strong>2015</strong> levels, although it increased by 1.5% between 2015 and 2016, and then <strong>decreased</strong> by <strong>1.8%</strong> between <strong>2016</strong> and <strong>2017</strong>. This is mainly driven by a <strong>2.6%</strong> increase in <strong>services consumption</strong> between <strong>2016</strong> and <strong>2017</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Services emissions intensity</strong> <strong>fell</strong> by <strong>5.2%</strong> between <strong>2015</strong> and <strong>2017</strong>. Between <strong>1998</strong> and <strong>2017</strong> it <strong>fell</strong> by <strong>34.3%</strong>, as a result of an underlying <strong>7.4%</strong> <strong>drop</strong> in <strong>emissions</strong> and a <strong>40.8%</strong> <strong>increase</strong> in <strong>GVA</strong> (2016 prices).</p>
