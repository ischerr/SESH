<p>It is possible to break down the reduction of Scotland&rsquo;s total energy consumption by <strong>sector</strong>, although the most recent data for this refers to <strong>2017 </strong>when consumption was <strong>12.1% </strong>lower than the 2005-07 baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Domestic </strong>and<strong> non-domestic </strong>consumption of electricity and heat dropped by approximately<strong> 16% </strong>against the 2005-07 baseline. By contrast, energy consumption in <strong>transport </strong>remained relatively stable in this period, increasing by<strong> 1.1%</strong>.</p>
<p>However, there have been <strong>increases</strong> in the most recent year across the board. Between <strong>2016</strong> and <strong>2017</strong>, <strong>non-domestic</strong> consumption <strong>increased</strong> by <strong>3.7%</strong>, consumption in <strong>transport</strong> <strong>up</strong> by <strong>2.9%</strong> and <strong>domestic</strong> consumption by <strong>1.4%</strong>.</p>
