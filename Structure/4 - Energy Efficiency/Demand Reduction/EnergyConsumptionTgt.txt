<p>The previous <strong>energy consumption target </strong>published in the <a href="https://www2.gov.scot/Publications/2010/10/07142301/0">Conserve and Save: Energy Efficiency Action Plan</a> in October 2010 was to reduce Scottish final energy consumption by <strong>12%</strong> by <strong>2020 </strong>from a 2005 to 2007 baseline (169,502 GWh). Scotland met the target in <strong>2013</strong>, seven years early, and reached a record low of energy consumption in <strong>2015</strong>, <strong>14.8%</strong> below the 2005-07 baseline. Energy efficiency, the impact of the economic cycles, prevalent energy price rises and weather patterns have all played a role in reducing overall energy consumption by over <strong>25,000 GWh</strong> from <strong>2005</strong> to <strong>2015</strong>.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, 2017 in particular, Scotland&rsquo;s energy consumption <strong>increased &ndash; </strong>in<strong> 2018 up </strong>by<strong> 3.2% </strong>on<strong> 2015</strong>. This mirrors trends witnessed across Europe, where energy consumption increased between 2016 and 2017 in most countries. In <strong>2018</strong>, total final energy consumption was <strong>12.1%</strong> <strong>lower</strong> than the <strong>2005-07 baseline</strong>. Scotland remains within the target to reduce consumption by 12% by 2020.</p>
