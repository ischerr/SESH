<p>Energy efficiency levels in the Scottish housing stock are monitored using the Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) using the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) and expressed as an Energy Efficiency Rating (EER). These ratings are banded from A to G, where A is a very efficient dwelling and G denotes a low energy efficiency dwelling.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/energy-efficient-scotland-route-map/">Energy Efficient Scotland: Routemap</a> sets an ambition for 'every Scottish home to achieve <strong>at least a band C </strong>in its Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) by <strong>2040</strong> (where technically feasible and cost effective).</p>
<p>There are three separate measures of energy performance certificates:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>SAP 2012 based on RdSAP (v9.93):</u> This is based on the latest methodology introduced in November 2017, therefore only data for <strong>2018</strong> is available. Under this measure, more than four in ten (<strong>43%</strong>) Scottish homes were rated at least <strong>EPC band C.</strong></li>
<li><u>SAP 2012 based on RdSAP (v9.92): </u>Under this measure based on the previous methodology, <strong>44%</strong> of Scottish homes were rated as <strong>EPC band C</strong> or better in <strong>2018</strong>, similar to the previous year. However, it is up from <strong>35%</strong> in <strong>2014</strong>, the first year in which data based on SAP 2012 is available.</li>
<li><u>SAP 2009:</u> This allows for comparisons over a longer period. Almost half of dwellings (<strong>49%</strong>) were rated <strong>C or better</strong> under this measure, doubling from <strong>24%</strong> in <strong>2010</strong>. This shows how the energy efficiency of dwellings in Scotland is improving.</li>
</ul>
<p>By way of comparison, <strong>34%</strong> of dwellings in <strong>England</strong> have an <strong>EPC</strong> rating of <strong>C</strong> or better according to the <strong>2018</strong> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-housing-survey#2018-to-2019">English Housing Survey</a>. This is based on SAP 2012. RdSAP changed to version 9.93 halfway through data collection.</p>

<p>The Energy Efficient Scotland Routemap sets further aims for energy efficiency of domestic properties based on housing <strong>tenure</strong>, which are as follows:</p>
<p><strong><u>Maximise </u></strong><u>the number of <strong>social rented </strong>homes achieving <strong>EPC B </strong>by <strong>2032</strong></u></p>
<p>Social rented dwellings are among the most energy efficient in the Scottish stock, likely to be a result of the characteristics of social sector dwellings &ndash; in particular a greater proportion of newer flats which tend to retain heat better than older dwellings and houses &ndash; and the improvements mandated under the Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS).</p>
<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, just <strong>3% </strong>of social rented homes are at <strong>EPC band B</strong>, however <strong>54% </strong>are at least <strong>band C</strong>.</p>
<p><u>All <strong>owner occupied </strong>homes to reach <strong>EPC C </strong>by <strong>2040</strong> (where technically feasible and cost effective)</u></p>
<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, <strong>37%</strong> of owner occupied homes were at least <strong>EPC band C</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>All private rented </u></strong><u>homes to <strong>EPC E </strong>by <strong>2022</strong>, to <strong>EPC D </strong>by <strong>2025</strong>, and to <strong>EPC C </strong>by <strong>2030 </strong>(where technically feasible and cost effective)</u></p>
<p>More than nine in ten (<strong>91%</strong>) private rented dwellings are at least <strong>EPC band E</strong>, <strong>75%</strong> are at least <strong>band D </strong>and <strong>44% </strong>at least <strong>band C </strong>in <strong>2018</strong>.</p>
<p>However, according to BEIS analysis using the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-energy-efficiency-data-framework-need-report-summary-of-analysis-2018">National Energy Efficiency Data Framework</a>, private renters in Scotland have had the greatest <strong>decrease </strong>in median <strong>gas consumption </strong>from <strong>2011 </strong>to <strong>2017</strong>, dropping by <strong>11.5% </strong>compared to 7.1% for socially rented homes and 5.8% for owner occupied homes.</p>
