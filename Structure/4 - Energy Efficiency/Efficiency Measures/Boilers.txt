<p>Boilers in Scottish homes have been improving rapidly as well. In <strong>2018</strong>, more than seven in ten (<strong>73%</strong>) dwellings had a <strong>condensing</strong> <strong>boiler</strong> and more than six in ten (<strong>62%</strong>) had a boiler that met the minimum efficiencies specified by the current <strong>Building Standards</strong>. The proportion of homes with these boiler types increased on <strong>2017</strong> (<strong>67%</strong> and <strong>57%</strong> respectively).</p>
<p>Average <strong>savings </strong>for installation of condensing boilers in Scottish homes are <strong>900 kWh </strong>or <strong>5.4% </strong>of energy consumption.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that all of these energy efficiency savings do not take into consideration the &ldquo;<strong>rebound effect</strong>&rdquo;. This is where savings achieved through energy efficiency may be minimised by resulting changes in behaviour. For example, as a consequence of getting a new boiler, people may use it more often, and may increase their heat demand.</p>
