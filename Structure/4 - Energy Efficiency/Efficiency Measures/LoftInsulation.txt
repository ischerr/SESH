<p>Loft insulation has improved rapidly over the last few years. In <strong>2018</strong>, <strong>94% </strong>of Scottish homes were <strong>insulated</strong> to <strong>100mm or more. </strong>This is unchanged from 2017, but up from <strong>73% </strong>in <strong>2007</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This can largely be attributed to the installation of top-up insulation in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>More than three-fifths (<strong>62%</strong>) of dwellings have loft <strong>insulation</strong> of <strong>200mm or more </strong>in<strong> 2018</strong>, a substantial rise from <strong>18% </strong>in <strong>2007</strong>. This is still short of the aim in Scottish Government&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> that <strong>70% </strong>of lofts in the residential sector will have at least <strong>200 mm </strong>of insulation by <strong>2020</strong>.</p>
<p>Between <strong>April 2008</strong> and <strong>December 2012</strong>, the UK government Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (<strong>CERT</strong>) scheme delivered <strong>410,937</strong> loft insulation measures in Scotland. Between <strong>January 2013</strong> and <strong>December 2018</strong> a further <strong>68,681</strong> loft insulation measures were delivered in Scotland by its successor scheme, the Energy Company Obligation (<strong>ECO</strong>). In total, around <strong>480,000</strong> loft insulation measures were installed under these government programs since 2008.</p>
<p>The <strong>impact </strong>of loft insulation in terms of energy saving is not as great as wall insulation; the average <strong>saving </strong>in 2016 for Scottish homes was <strong>200 kWh</strong>, or <strong>0.9% </strong>of energy consumption.</p>
