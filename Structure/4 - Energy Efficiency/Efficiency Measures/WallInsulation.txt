<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, almost six out of every ten dwellings (<strong>59%</strong>) had some form of <strong>wall insulation</strong>. This comes close to meeting the aim in Scottish Government&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/">Climate Change Plan</a> that <strong>60%</strong> of walls will be insulated by <strong>2020</strong>. The proportion of dwelling with wall insulation is similar to 2017, but the longer term trend shows an increase (<strong>42%</strong> in <strong>2007</strong>).</p>
<p>There is a big difference between cavity and solid wall dwellings, however; <strong>73% </strong>of cavity wall dwellings have <strong>cavity wall insulation </strong>whereas just <strong>19% </strong>of solid wall dwellings have <strong>solid wall insulation </strong>in<strong> 2018</strong>. Both types of insulation have seen longer term improvements but are unchanged on last year.</p>
<p>Between <strong>April 2008</strong> and <strong>December 2012</strong>, the <strong>CERT</strong> scheme delivered around <strong>218,000 cavity</strong> and <strong>9,000 solid</strong> and other wall insulation measures in Scotland. Between <strong>January 2013</strong> and <strong>December 2018</strong> a further <strong>100,328 cavity</strong> and <strong>59,828 solid</strong> wall insulation measures were delivered in Scotland by the successor <strong>ECO</strong> scheme. This equates to around <strong>387,000</strong> <strong>wall insulation measures</strong>, including around 318,000 cavity wall insulation measures, installed under these programs by the end of 2018.</p>
<p>We can look at the <strong>impact </strong>of wall insulation in terms of energy consumption and cost savings using BEIS&rsquo; <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/720120/Scotland_impact_of_measures_2015.xlsx">impact of measures</a> analysis. It looks at savings between the years 2015 and 2017 where wall insulation has been installed in 2016. <strong>Cavity wall insulation </strong>saved Scottish homes an average of <strong>1,100 kWh </strong>or <strong>5.0% </strong>of <strong>energy consumption </strong>and <strong>solid wall insulation </strong>saved <strong>1,500 kWh </strong>or <strong>11.5% </strong>of <strong>energy consumption</strong>.</p>
