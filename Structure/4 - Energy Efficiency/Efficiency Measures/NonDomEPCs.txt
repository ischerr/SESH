<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/energy-efficient-scotland-route-map/">Energy Efficient Scotland: Routemap</a> sets an objective for non-domestic buildings to be assessed for energy efficiency and improved to the extent this is technically feasible and cost effective by 2040.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government published an analysis of non-domestic EPCs in the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-non-domestic-energy-efficiency-baseline/pages/3/">Scottish Government&rsquo;s Non-Domestic Energy Efficiency Baseline</a> in December 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp; It shows that just <strong>13.5% </strong>of <strong>non-domestic </strong>buildings have an <strong>EPC</strong> rating of <strong>C or above</strong>. More than half (<strong>55.9%</strong>) of <strong>non-domestic </strong>properties are <strong>EPC bands F or G</strong>, the least efficient properties.</p>
<p>There are big differences between the energy efficiency of different types of non-domestic properties in Scotland - <strong>storage and distribution</strong> and <strong>education </strong>buildings tend to be the <strong>most energy efficient </strong>(<strong>39.1% </strong>and <strong>37.0% </strong>respectively at EPC band C or above), whereas <strong>hotels </strong>(<strong>1.5%</strong>) and <strong>restaurants</strong>, <strong>cafes </strong>and <strong>takeaways </strong>(<strong>0.5%</strong>) tend to be the <strong>least efficient</strong>.</p>
<p>EPC ratings for <strong>industrial </strong>buildings are similar to the non-domestic sector as a whole, with <strong>15.0% </strong>at least at <strong>band C</strong>.</p>
