<p>Fostering the idea that consumers have choice with their suppliers and take a proactive approach with energy is a key aspect of consumer engagement. Not all customers are in a position to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Switching </strong>is a key aspect of this. According to data from <a href="https://www.cas.org.uk/news/new-data-shows-huge-differences-across-scotland-energy-switching-rates">Citizen&rsquo;s Advice Scotland</a> and Electralink, <strong>18.6% </strong>of Scottish consumers switched their <strong>electricity </strong>supplier in <strong>2018</strong>. There are big regional differences, with a greater proportion of people living in local authorities in the <strong>South of Scotland </strong>switching their electricity supplier. <strong>East Renfrewshire</strong> has the highest proportion of customers who have switched (<strong>22.4%</strong>), while <strong>Shetland</strong> has the lowest (<strong>9.9%</strong>).</p>
