<p>Fuel poverty is the inability to heat a home to an acceptable standard at a reasonable cost. Under the current definition of fuel poverty a household is in <strong>fuel poverty </strong>if, in order to maintain a satisfactory heating regime, it would be required to spend more than <strong>10% </strong>of its <strong>income </strong>on <strong>fuel use</strong>. <strong>Extreme fuel poverty </strong>is defined as a household spending more than <strong>20%</strong>. The fuel poverty definition differs in England and Wales so it is not possible to make comparisons with Scotland.</p>
<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, <strong>25.0%</strong> of households were estimated to be in fuel poverty, a similar level to <strong>2017</strong>. The 2018 fuel poverty rate is likely to reflect changes in fuel prices, income and energy efficiency. <strong>11.3%</strong> were living in <strong>extreme fuel poverty</strong> in <strong>2018</strong>. The rate of extreme fuel poverty has been <strong>decreasing</strong> since <strong>2013</strong> (<strong>16.0%</strong>) and is the lowest rate recorded by the survey since 2012.</p>
<p>Households who have <strong>gas</strong> as their primary fuel type are significantly less likely to be in fuel poverty. Just <strong>23%</strong> of gas households are in fuel poverty, whereas <strong>43%</strong> of households that use <strong>electric </strong>heating are fuel poor.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency of homes is closely linked with fuel poverty; just <strong>19% </strong>of households with an <strong>EPC band </strong>of <strong>B or C </strong>are fuel poor, compared to <strong>29%</strong> at <strong>band D</strong>, <strong>31%</strong> at <strong>band E </strong>and <strong>39% </strong>at <strong>bands F or G</strong>. The Energy Efficient Scotland Routemap sets the aim for all homes with households in fuel poverty to reach EPC C by 2030 and EPC B by 2040 (where technically feasible and cost effective).</p>
<p>In July 2019 the Fuel Poverty (Targets, Definition and Strategy) (Scotland) Act received Royal Assent. This Act contains a new definition of fuel poverty which affects how fuel poverty is to be defined and measured. The first set of fuel poverty estimates fully compatible with all of the elements of the new definition in the Fuel Poverty (Targets, Definition and Strategy) (Scotland) Act are expected to be published in December 2021.</p>
