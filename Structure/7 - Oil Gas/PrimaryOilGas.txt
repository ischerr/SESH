<p>Oil and gas remains an integral part of Scotland&rsquo;s energy system. The chart looks at the <strong>primary energy, </strong>in other words, fuels as they enter the Scottish energy system. This refers to the all the energy produced within Scotland plus all the energy imported into Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>Oil </strong>accounts for more than half of primary energy (<strong>55.2%</strong>), with <strong>gas </strong>making up <strong>35.7% </strong>and <strong>petroleum products </strong>making up <strong>3.0% </strong>in <strong>2018</strong>. This makes up a total of <strong>93.9% </strong>of Scotland&rsquo;s primary energy (encompassing all of Scotland&rsquo;s indigenous production and imports). This is the highest percentage of oil and gas as a proportion of Scotland&rsquo;s primary energy, which may be explained by the increase in production of oil and the fall in coal as a source of primary energy in recent years.</p>
