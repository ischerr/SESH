<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, Scotland (including Scottish adjacent waters) <strong>produced </strong>an estimated<strong> 53.1 </strong>million tonnes of oil equivalent (<strong>mtoe</strong>) of crude <strong>oil </strong>and natural gas liquids (NGLs) (equivalent to <strong>617 TWh</strong>). While this is approximately 40% of its peak 1999, it is an <strong>increase </strong>of <strong>8.5%</strong> on <strong>2017</strong>. Production across the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) has increased steadily since 2014 following several years of substantial investment in the development of new and existing fields. <strong>Scotland </strong>accounts for <strong>95.3% </strong>of total <strong>UK</strong> crude oil and NGLs <strong>production</strong>.</p>
<p>Scotland produced <strong>24.1 mtoe </strong>of natural <strong>gas </strong>in <strong>2018 </strong>(equivalent to <strong>280 TWh</strong>), although this has dropped for each of the last two years. It accounts for <strong>62.4% </strong>of total <strong>UK </strong>gas production. This is the equivalent of almost <strong>six times Scotland&rsquo;s gas consumption</strong>.</p>
