<p>Comparisons of renewable heat can be made with EU countries, and these comparisons refer to <strong>non-electrical </strong>renewable heating and cooling.</p>
<p>In contrast to renewable electricity where Scotland performs strongly relative to Europe, it is the <strong>lowest of all countries </strong>for <strong>renewable heat</strong>. It is below the <strong>UK </strong>share as a whole of <strong>7.4% </strong>and well below the <strong>EU</strong> average of <strong>19.5%</strong>.</p>
<p>* EU and UK figures are not strictly comparable with Scotland due to different methodologies used to calculate the figures and availability of Scottish specific figures. This data should be used as a broad indication only.</p>
