<p>Since&nbsp;<strong>2000</strong>, Scottish renewables have&nbsp;<strong>displaced&nbsp;</strong>an estimated&nbsp;<strong>124 million tonnes&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>CO2</strong>&nbsp;across the GB system, assuming that the same amount of electricity would be generated by fossil fuels.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>2017&nbsp;</strong>alone, Scottish renewable electricity has displaced an estimated&nbsp;<strong>11.6 million tonnes of CO2.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The estimated amount of CO2 displaced has dropped from its&nbsp;<strong>peak&nbsp;</strong>of&nbsp;<strong>13.6 million tonnes&nbsp;</strong>of CO2 in&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>2015&nbsp;</strong>because in recent years coal power stations have closed, and renewables have tended to displace more gas rather than coal.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has had the effect of reducing the carbon intensity of the remaining fossil fuel fleet across Britain and therefore the level of displaced emissions.</p>
<p>For context, the latest figures for greenhouse gas emissions (2016) for Scotland as a whole is 38.6 million tonnes of CO2.</p>
