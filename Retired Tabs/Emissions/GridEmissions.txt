<p>The shift towards&nbsp;<strong>low carbon</strong>&nbsp;electricity generation had a profound impact on&nbsp;<strong>emissions</strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>, each kilowatt hour of electricity generated in Scotland added an estimated&nbsp;<strong>24.0&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere (gCO2e/kWh), a sizeable drop from&nbsp;<strong>150.9 gCO2e/kWh&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2015</strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;This has been driven by both the&nbsp;<strong>increase&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>low carbon renewable generation&nbsp;</strong>and the&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>closure&nbsp;</strong>of Scotland's last&nbsp;<strong>coal power station&nbsp;</strong>at Longannet in early 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;The drop to 24&nbsp; gCO2e/kWh&nbsp;in 2017&nbsp;puts grid intensity below the 50 gCO2e/kWh ambition for 2020 outlined in the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-governments-climate-change-plan-third-report-proposals-policies-2018/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1567601383143000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGO06isAesSVH3XZBSFod2vwhgNDA">Climate Change Plan</a>&nbsp;three years early.</p>
