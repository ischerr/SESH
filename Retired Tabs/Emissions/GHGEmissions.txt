<p>Approximately&nbsp;<strong>4,800 GWh&nbsp;</strong>of renewable heat was generated in Scotland in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the equivalent of supplying over&nbsp;<strong>350,000 Scottish homes&nbsp;</strong>with gas for the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2009 Renewable Heat Action Plan set a target of delivering&nbsp;<strong>11%&nbsp;</strong>of Scotland&rsquo;s projected 2020 non-electrical heat demand from renewable sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;<strong>2017</strong>, the equivalent of&nbsp;<strong>5.9%&nbsp;</strong>of non-electrical heat demand was met from renewable sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that between&nbsp;<strong>8,100&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;<strong>9,300 GWh&nbsp;</strong>renewable heat generation is required to&nbsp;<strong>meet&nbsp;</strong>the&nbsp;<strong>11%</strong>&nbsp;renewable heat&nbsp;<strong>target</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The share of renewable heat is up from&nbsp;<strong>4.7%&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>2016</strong>&nbsp;and makes it a record year for renewable heat (5.3% in 2015 was the previous peak).&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of this increase this year is due to&nbsp;<strong>increased generation&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;from existing&nbsp;<strong>large commercial sites</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of this increase is made up of a rise in the generation of renewable heat by&nbsp;<strong>biomass</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This also makes up more than four-fifths of all renewable heat generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thermal energy from waste and heat pumps each make up less than 10% of renewable heat output.</p>
