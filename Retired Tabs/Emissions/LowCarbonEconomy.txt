<p>In 2017, the low carbon and renewable energy (LCRE)* sector has <strong>directly </strong>supported <strong>21,500 </strong>full-time equivalent <strong>jobs </strong>in Scotland. This represents around <strong>10% </strong>of employment in the <strong>UK </strong>LCRE sector. Most of this is made up of staff employed in <strong>energy efficiency </strong>(<strong>10,100 </strong>full-time equivalent staff) and <strong>low carbon electricity </strong>(<strong>8,300</strong>)<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Additionally, the LCRE sector in Scotland is estimated to <strong>indirectly </strong>support a further <strong>25,000 </strong>FTE jobs in the wider economy; this refers to jobs in the supply chain involved in low carbon activities. This means that the low carbon and renewable energy economy supported an estimated <strong>46,500</strong> jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2017, the Scottish low carbon and renewable energy economy directly generated <strong>&pound;5.9 billion</strong>; representing around <strong>2.4% </strong>of all non-financial <strong>turnover </strong>in <strong>Scotland</strong>. In comparison, the <strong>UK </strong>figure was <strong>1.2%</strong>. Including indirect activity, the low carbon and renewable energy sector generated a <strong>turnover </strong>of <strong>&pound;11.1 billion </strong>in <strong>2017</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The <strong>renewable energy </strong>part of the LCRE sector is particularly important in Scotland where it accounts for approximately <strong>49%</strong> of <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s low-carbon turnover</strong>. In contrast, renewable energy accounts for around <strong>34% </strong>of LCRE turnover in the <strong>UK </strong>as a whole.</p>
<p>* The &lsquo;renewable&rsquo; sector includes renewable electricity, heat and energy from waste and biomass. The &lsquo;low carbon&rsquo; sector includes nuclear electricity, energy efficient products, low carbon financial and advisory services, low emissions vehicles, infrastructure, fuel cells and energy storage</p>
